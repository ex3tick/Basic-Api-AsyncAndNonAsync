# Basic-Api-NonAsync
I've built a simple C# API with essential CRUD services (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and their corresponding controllers. The current implementation is synchronous. Explore the API for basic operations. For improved scalability, consider adding asynchronous functionality to services and controllers.

Backend Setup
To get started with the backend, follow these steps:

Update Migrations:
Run the following command to update migrations and initialize the database:

bash
Copy code
dotnet ef database update
Ready to Use:
Once migrations are updated, the backend is ready to use.

Feel free to explore the API and adapt it to your needs. If you encounter any issues or have questions, refer to the documentation or contact the project maintainers.

Adjust the "Project Name" section to match the actual name of your project.
