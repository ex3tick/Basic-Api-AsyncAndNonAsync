Basic Fullstack StarterKit - Backend
Overview
Welcome to the backend of the Basic Fullstack StarterKit! This .NET Core API is tailored to seamlessly integrate with the associated frontend [(Basic Angular Frontend)](https://github.com/ex3tick/Basic-Angular-Frontend), providing a robust foundation for building dynamic applications. It comes pre-equipped with essential services and controllers for common CRUD operations.

Basic Services and Controllers
The backend is thoughtfully crafted, featuring implemented services and controllers for fundamental operations such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. This design ensures a straightforward yet extensible structure, allowing developers to customize and enhance functionality based on specific application needs.

Database Setup
The only step remaining to make the backend fully functional is to update the database. Execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
dotnet ef database update
This command initializes the database and ensures that it is in sync with the current state of the application.

Extensibility and Customization
The backend is architected with extensibility in mind. Developers can effortlessly extend functionality by adding new services or controllers. The codebase is well-documented, providing insights into the implementation details for easy customization.

Usage Guidelines
Exploration:
Dive into the source code to understand the implemented services and controllers. Explore how each operation is handled to gain insights for further customization.

Customization:
Leverage the extensibility of the backend to tailor services and controllers according to your unique application requirements.

Database Update:
After customization, run the database update command (dotnet ef database update) to apply changes to the database schema.
